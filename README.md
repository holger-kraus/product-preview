This a solution for a challenge on Frontend Mentor. It was a lot of fun solving it.
One difficulty was , that I didn't want to include Google Fonts remotely, because in Germany you can get legal problems for doing so.
So I had to find a way to include the necessary fonts locally. Luckily I found Tranfonter, which generates the neeeded cSS typefaces when you upload the font files. This knowledge will be usefu in future projects.
